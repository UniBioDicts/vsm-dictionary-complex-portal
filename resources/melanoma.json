Required for chromosome segregation at repetitive sequences.  Localizes to repetitive elements such as the rDNA and telomeres  where is is thought to promote and resolve HR-dependent intermediates. Also required for telomere maintenance during replication and telomere elongation and for  SUMOylating components of the replisome, such as MCM2 (P29469) and the POL2 (P21951) subunit of the DNA polymerase epsilon complex (CPX-2110), which is important for replication fork progression in the presence of DNA-damaging agents."],"complex_systematic_name":["KRE29:MMS21:NSE1:NSE3:NSE4:NSE5:SMC5:SMC6"],"complex_synonym":["Resolvin complex"],"organism":["yeast; 559292"]}}],"facets":[]}
